# Minimal Manuals

> The purest application of cognitive load theory may be John Carrollʼs minimal manual \[Carr1987,Carr2014\]. Its starting point is a quote from a user: “I want to do something, not learn how to do everything.” Carroll and colleagues redesigned training to present every idea as a single-page self-contained task: a title describing what the page was about, step-by-step instructions of how to do just one thing (e.g. how to delete a blank line in a text editor), and then several notes on how to recognize and debug common problems. They found that rewriting training materials this way made them shorter overall, and that people using them learned faster. Later studies confirmed that this approach outperformed the traditional approach regardless of prior experience with computers \[Lazo1993\].\[Carr2014\] summarized this work by saying:

> Our “minimalist” designs sought to leverage user initiative and prior knowledge, instead of controlling it through warnings and ordered steps. It emphasized that users typically bring much expertise and insight to this learning, for example, knowledge about the task domain, and that such knowledge could be a resource to instructional designers. Minimalism leveraged episodes of error recognition, diagnosis, and recovery, instead of attempting to merely forestall error. It framed troubleshooting and recovery as learning opportunities instead of as aberrations.
