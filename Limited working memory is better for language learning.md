There is a strong similarity between the theoretical analysis of Kareev and earlier proposals that a large short-term memory capacity can be a liability rather than a strength in the early stages of language learning. Newport (1990) discussed a “less is more” hypothesis to explain why language learners who are developmentally immature at the time of initial learning have an advantage over more mature learners for some language constructs. An alternative to the nativist theory of language learning, this theory states that immature language learners grasp only small fragments of language at a time, which helps them to break up a complex language structure into smaller parts. Consistent with this proposal, Elman (1993) found that a computer implementation of a parallel distributed processing model of cognition learned complex language structure more easily if the short-term memory capacity of the model started out small and increased later in the learning process, rather than taking on its mature value at the beginning of learning.
