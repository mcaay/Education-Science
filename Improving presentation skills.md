> Taking notes is more efficient when you have some kind of rubric so that youʼre not scrambling to write your observations while the person youʼre observing is still talking. The simplest rubric for free-form comments from a group is a 2x2 grid whose vertical axis is labeled “what went well” and “what can be improved”, and whose horizontal axis is labeled “content” (what was said) and “presentation” (how it was said). Observers write their comments on sticky notes as they watch the demonstration, then post those in the quadrants of a grid drawn on a whiteboard (Figure below).

# How to Practice Performance

> The best way to improve your in-person lesson delivery is to watch yourself do it:
> - Work in groups of three.
> - Each person rotates through the roles of teacher, audience, and videographer. The teacher has 2 minutes to explain something. The person pretending to be the audience is there to be attentive, while the videographer records the session using a cellphone or other handheld device.
> - After everyone has finished teaching, the whole group watches the videos together. Everyone gives feedback on all three videos, i.e. people give feedback on themselves as well as on others.
> - After the videos have been discussed, they are deleted. (Many people are justifiably uncomfortable about images of themselves appearing online.)
> - Finally, the whole class reconvenes and adds all the feedback to a shared 2x2 grid of the kind described above without saying who each item of feedback is about.

> In order for this exercise to work well:
> - Record all three videos and then watch all three. If the cycle is teach-review-teach-review, the last person to teach invariably runs short of time (sometimes on purpose). Doing all the reviewing after all the teaching also helps put a bit of distance between the two, which makes the exercise slightly less excruciating.
> - Let people know at the start of the class that they will be asked to teach something so that they have time to choose a topic. Telling them this too far in advance can be counter-productive, since some people will fret over how much they should prepare.
> - Groups must be physically separated to reduce audio cross-talk between their recordings. In practice, this means 2–3 groups in a normal-sized classroom, with the rest using nearby breakout spaces, coffee lounges, offices, or (on one occasion) a janitorʼs storage closet.
> - People must give feedback on themselves as well as on each other so that they can calibrate their impressions of their own teaching against those of other people. Most people are harder on themselves than they ought to be, and itʼs important for them to realize this.

> ==The announcement of this exercise is often greeted with groans and apprehension, since few people enjoy seeing or hearing themselves. However, those same people consistently rate it as one of the most valuable parts of teaching workshops.== Itʼs also good preparation for co-teaching (Section 9.3): teachers find it a lot easier to give each other informal feedback if they have had some practice doing so and have a shared rubric to set expectations.

> And speaking of rubrics: once the class has put all of their feedback on a shared grid, pick a handful of positive and negative comments, write them up as a checklist, and have them do the exercise again. Most people are more comfortable the second time around, and being assessed on the things that they themselves have decided are important increases their sense of self-determination (Chapter 10).
