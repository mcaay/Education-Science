Take a look at this clip of Richard Feynman:

When you take the thought process of Feynman of starting at a random regular event, like a grandma falling or someone being late to class, and asking "why" over and over, eventually you will arrive at the most fundamental physics principles governing the world.

Then you can't go any further. Maybe there is a reason "why", but we don't know it yet. As far as we know, we simply live in the universe that has these few laws and we don't know why. This is just how it is.

Ok, and what can we do with it, let's say, for teaching kids?

Imagine a teacher who, for his own training, makes a tree of notes in a program like Obsidian. The starting notes are random regular situations from daily life, and then from those regular situations he starts to ask why and creates notes deeper and deeper until he gets to the most fundamental laws in physics.

At the bottom, he will have just a handful of physical laws and at the top he will have hundreds, if not thousands of regular situations. Those regular situations over the process of asking why will merge ways into concrete physical laws.

Then, in the classroom, or in a video series or whatever, he might choose the most regular event that just happened maybe today, or in the news, or to someone of the students, and start generating the tree from there in front of the students eyes.

Sometimes you would get stuck on a biology or a psychology question that would be hard to simplify further to a physics question. So here appears a room for all those different subjects to enter the scene. Math would be needed to understand the answer to many of those questions.

This gives me idea, that there should be a minimal set of situations and corresponding why questions and their answers, which could constitute the entire learning of a high school student.

When kids are born and learn to speak, they ask very many why questions. Then the parents get overwhelmed and irritated and teach their children to stop asking those questions. But this is indeed how children want to learn about how the world works. The world is unbelievably complicated. The amount of questions is enormous. This is the way to teach that is the best suited for our brains.
