# Peer Instruction

> *No matter how good a teacher is, they can only say one thing at a time. How then can they clear up many different misconceptions in a reasonable time? The best solution developed so far is a technique called peer instruction. Originally created by Eric Mazur at Harvard \[Mazu1996\], it has been studied extensively in a wide variety of contexts, including programming \[Crou2001,Port2013\], and \[Port2016\] found that learners value peer instruction even at first contact.*

> *Peer instruction attempts to provide one-to-one instruction in a scalable way by interleaving formative assessment with learner discussion:*
> 1. *Give a brief introduction to the topic.*
> 2. *Give learners a multiple choice question that probes for their misconceptions (rather than testing simple factual knowledge).*
> 3. *Have all the learners vote on their answers to the MCQ.*
> 	- *If the learners all have the right answer, move on.*
> 	- *If they all have the same wrong answer, address that specific misconception.*
> 	- *If they have a mix of right and wrong answers, give them several minutes to argue with each other in groups of 2–4, then vote again.*

> *As [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LbuoxAy56o) shows, group discussion significantly improves learnersʼ understanding because it uncovers gaps in their reasoning and forces them to clarify their thinking. Re-polling the class then lets the teacher know if they can move on or if further explanation is necessary. A final round of additional explanation after the correct answer is presented gives learners one more chance to solidify their understanding.*

> *But could this be a false positive? Are results improving because of increased understanding during discussion or simply from a follow-the-leader effect (“vote like Jane, sheʼs always right”)?\[Smit2009\] tested this by following the first question with a second one that learners answered individually. They found that peer discussion actually does enhance understanding, even when none of the learners in a discussion group originally knew the correct answer. As long as there is a diversity of opinion within the group, their misconceptions cancel out.*

> [!Taking a Stand]
> It is important to have learners vote publicly so that they canʼt change their minds afterward and rationalize it by making excuses to themselves like “I just misread the question.” Much of the value of peer instruction comes from the hypercorrection of getting the wrong answer and having to think through the reasons why (Section 5.1).
