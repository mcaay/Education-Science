# Plan for Mixed Abilities

> *If your learners have widely varying levels of prior knowledge, you can easily wind up in a situation where a third of your class is lost and a third is bored. Thatʼs unsatisfying for everyone, but there are some strategies you can use to manage the situation:
    - Before running a workshop, communicate its level clearly to everyone by showing a few examples of exercises that they will be asked to complete. This helps potential participants gauge the level of the class far more effectively than a point-form list of topics.
    - Provide extra self-paced exercises so that more advanced learners donʼt finish early and get bored.
    - Keep an eye out for learners who are falling behind and intervene early so that they donʼt become frustrated and give up.
    - Ask more advanced learners to help people next to them (see Section 9.6 below).*

> *One other way to accommodate mixed abilities is to have everyone work through material on their own at their own pace as they would in an online course, but to do it simultaneously and side by side with helpers roaming the room to get people unstuck. Some people will go three or four times further than others when workshops are run like this, but everyone will have had a rewarding and challenging day.*

> [!False Beginners]
> *A false beginner is someone who has studied a language before but is learning it again. They may be indistinguishable from absolute beginners on pre-assessment tests, but they are able to move much more quickly once the class starts because they are re-learning rather than learning for the first time.*
> 
> *Being a false beginner is often a sign of preparatory privilege \[Marg2010\], and false beginners are common in free-range programming classes. For example, a child whose family is affluent enough to have sent them to a robotics summer camp may do poorly on a pre-test of programming knowledge because the material isnʼt fresh in their mind, but still has an advantage over a child from a less fortunate background. The strategies described above can help level the playing field in cases like this, but again, the real solution is to use your own privilege to address larger out-of-class factors \[Part2011\].*

> *The most important thing is to accept that you canʼt help everyone all of the time. If you slow down to accommodate two people who are struggling, you are failing the other eighteen. Equally, if you spend a few minutes talking about an advanced topic to a learner who is bored, the rest of the class will feel left out.*
