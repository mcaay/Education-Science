# Faded Examples

> Another type of exercise that can be explained in terms of cognitive load is to give learners a series of faded examples. The first example in a series presents a complete use of a particular problem-solving strategy. The next problem is of the same type, but has some gaps for the learner to fill in. Each successive problem gives the learner less scaffolding, until they are asked to solve a complete problem from scratch. When teaching high school algebra, for example, we might start with this:

> and then ask learners to solve this:

> and this:

> and finally this:

> Faded examples work because they introduce the problem-solving strategy piece by piece: at each step, learners have one new problem to tackle, which is less intimidating than a blank screen or a blank sheet of paper (Section 9.11). It also encourages learners to think about the similarities and differences between various approaches, which helps create the linkages in their mental models that help retrieval.

> The key to constructing a good faded example is to think about the problem-solving strategy it is meant to teach. For example, the programming problems above all use the accumulator design pattern, in which the results of processing items from a collection are repeatedly added to a single variable in some way to create the final result.
