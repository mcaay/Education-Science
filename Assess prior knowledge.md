# Assess Prior Knowledge

> *The more you know about your learners before you start teaching, the more you will be able to help them. Inside a formal school system, the prerequisites to your course will tell you something about what theyʼre likely to already know. In a free-range setting, though, your learners may be much more diverse, so you may want to give them a short survey or questionnaire in advance of your class to find out what knowledge and skills they have.*

> *Asking people to rate themselves on a scale from 1 to 5 is pointless because the less people know about a subject, the less accurately they can estimate their knowledge , a phenomenon called the Dunning-Kruger effect \[Krug1999\]. Conversely, people who are members of underrepresented groups will often underrate their skills.*

> *Rather than asking people to self-assess, you can ask them how easily they could complete some specific tasks. Doing this is risky, though, because school trains people to treat anything that looks like an exam as something they have to pass rather than as a chance to shape instruction. If someone answers “I donʼt know” to even a couple of questions on your pre-assessment, they might conclude that your class is too advanced for them. You could therefore scare off many of the people you most want to help.*

> *Section 21.5 presents a short pre-assessment questionnaire that most potential learners are unlikely to find intimidating. If you use it or anything like it, try to follow up with people who donʼt respond to find out why not and compare your evaluation of learners with their self-assessment to improve your questions.*

# Pre-Assessment Questionnaire

> *This questionnaire helps teachers gauge the prior programming knowledge of participants in an introductory JavaScript workshop. The questions and answers are concrete, and the whole thing is short so that respondents wonʼt find it intimidating.*
