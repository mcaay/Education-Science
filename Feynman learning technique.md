# The technique

1. Write the name of the concept that you are trying to learn at the top of the page    
2. Explain the concept in <span style="color: #F84;"><b>plain words</b></span> - it is not allowed to use technical terms
3. Wherever it is difficult to put something in plain words, that means your understanding is not enough and you need to check sources again until you <span style="color: #F33;"><b>CAN</b></span> put it in plain words
4. Look at what you wrote and try to simplify it further as much as possible

# Thoughts

This technique results in very deep learning, but is also very time consuming.
