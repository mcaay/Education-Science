The quote below is of huge importance. I must verify if what he said is true. I suspect it is, but not because the quality of the teachers doesn't matter. I think the teachers are mostly on the dumb side and training them will not change their skills much. You must put effort into bringing the brilliant teachers in and such people will take care of their own education, so you don't need to try to invent a program for them. Salman Khan said that students that have a private tutor are 2 standard deviations above the norm, so the quality of the teaching must be of high importance. It's just that training stupid teachers and switching one set of mediocre administrators for another set of slightly less mediocre administrators doesn't give worthwhile results.

>The Coleman report was a famous report about education and they measured all kinds of variables about schools, about teachers and they looked at academic achievement as an outcome and they found *the most predictive variables* of education outcome were the variables the student brought *with him or her* into the school, essentially their ability. And that when you combine the school and the teacher variables *together* - the quality of the school, the funding of the school, the quality of the teachers, their education, you put all the teacher and school variables together - it barely accounted for 10% of the variants. And this has been replicated now, you know, so the best research we have shows that school variables and teacher variables *together* account for about 10% of student academic achievement. Now you want to have some policy on improving academic achievement, how much money do you want to put into teacher education? How much money you want to put into the quality of the school administration? You know who you can ask, you can ask the Gates Foundation because they spent a tremendous amount of money doing that and they, at the end of it, because they're measurement people, they want to, you know, they want to know the data, they've found it had no impact at all. And they've kind of pulled out of that kind of program.
