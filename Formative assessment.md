> ==People learn fastest when teachers identify and clear up learnersʼ misconceptions as the lesson is being delivered.== This is called formative assessment because it forms (or shapes) the teaching while it is taking place. Learners donʼt pass or fail formative assessment; instead, it gives both the teacher and the learner feedback on how well they are doing and what they should focus on next. For example, a music teacher might ask a learner to play a scale very slowly to check their breathing. The learner finds out if they are breathing correctly, while the teacher gets feedback on whether the explanation they just gave made sense.

> MCQs arenʼt the only kind of formative assessment: Chapter 12 describes other kinds of exercises that are quick and unambiguous. ==Whatever you pick, you should do something that takes a minute or two every 10–15 minutes to make sure that your learners are actually learning. This rhythm isnʼt based on an intrinsic attentional limit: [Wils2007] found little support for the often-repeated claim that learners can only pay attention for 10–15 minutes. Instead, the guideline ensures that if a significant number of people have fallen behind, you only have to repeat a short portion of the lesson.== Frequent formative assessments also keep learners engaged, particularly if they involved small-group discussion (Section 9.2).

> Formative assessments can also be used before lessons. If you start a class with an MCQ and everyone answers it correctly, you can avoid explaining something that your learners already know. This kind of active teaching gives you more time to focus on things they donʼt know. It also shows learners that you respect their time enough not to waste it, which helps with motivation (Chapter 10).

> The spread of responses to a formative assessment guides what you do next. If enough of the class has the right answer, you move on. If the majority of the class chooses the same wrong answer, you should go back and work on correcting the misconception that distractor points to. If their answers are evenly split between several options they are probably just guessing, so you should back up and re-explain the idea in a different way. (Repeating exactly the same explanation will probably not be useful, which is one of things that makes so many video courses pedagogically ineffective.)

> What if most of the class votes for the right answer but a few vote for wrong ones? In that case, you have to decide whether you should spend time getting the minority caught up or whether itʼs more important to keep the majority engaged. No matter how hard you work or what teaching practices you use, you wonʼt always be able to give everyone what they need; itʼs your responsibility as a teacher to make the call.

> Working formative assessments into class only requires a little bit of preparation and practice. Giving learners colored or numbered cards so that they can all answer an MCQ at once (rather than holding up their hands in turn), having one of the options be, “I have no idea,” and encouraging them to talk to their neighbors for a few seconds before answering will all help ensure that your teaching flow isnʼt disrupted. Section 9.2 describes a powerful, evidence-based teaching method that builds on these simple ideas.
