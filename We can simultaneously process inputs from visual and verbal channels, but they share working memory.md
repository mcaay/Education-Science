> *Figure above is a simplified model of human cognitive architecture. The core of this model is the separation between short-term and long-term memory discussed in Section 3.2. Long-term memory is like your basement: it stores things more or less permanently, but you can始t access its contents directly. Instead, you rely on your short-term memory, which is the cluttered kitchen table of your mind.*

> *When you need something, your brain retrieves it from long-term memory and puts it in short-term memory. Conversely, new information that arrives in short-term memory has to be encoded to be stored in long-term memory. If that information isn始t encoded and stored, it始s not remembered and learning hasn始t taken place.*
