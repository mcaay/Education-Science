# Case of Wikipedia

Wikipedia is a huge body of knowledge and it is not structured like a tree, and yet it is hugely successful. As such, it is a good example to consider pros and cons of a tree like system vs. other systems.

Wikipedia is structured in a way that can be called a Zettelkasten system. The characteristics of such a system are:
- all the articles are placed in the same "folder" - there is no such thing as folders within folders that eventually have some articles in a given category;
- articles link to other articles extensively - that is the main way of finding connections to other articles and related topics.

Those characteristics result in something great in some aspects and poor in other aspects. The advantages are:
- it is very easy for creators (who are volunteers) to create new articles, because they do not have to think where to place the articles on a giant structure of a tree
	- this we can say prioritises the ease of putting knowledge "out there"
	- if it was harder for the creators to create articles, wikipedia would have way fewer articles, many orders of magnitude fewer
- since there is a search functionality (either the wikipedia one or through Google), we can look up a word, a concept, a city, a person or nearly anything else that caught our interest in a given moment very easily
- the types of articles do not concern the creators - it doesn't matter if the article concerns a concept, city or a person - it all goes to the one giant "folder" anyway
	- in a tree like system categories of articles are very important - if you create an article about a person, let's say Albert Einstein, it will be in a completely different place on the tree than say a concept like special relativity

The disadvantages are:
- it is not easy to explore the knowledge
	- if you wanted to learn comprehensively about some subject, let's say about the education, you could read a hundred articles and you wouldn't know if you went through 90% of the articles already or 1%
		- on a tree like system you can visually see where you are and how many articles are in a category that interests you
	- the articles that are about scientific facts are mixed with articles that are just speculation or even already proven to be untrue, which you could only learn are untrue by spending time on reading the contents of the article
		- on a tree-like system you can very clearly separate scientific facts from speculation and from non-facts
- it is not easy to find out what you don't know
	- if you know what you want to look up on Wikipedia it's all good, but if you don't know what you don't know... how do you get from that point to the point of knowing what you don't know? You could find the article on education and start opening the links to related articles in separate tabs, and then related articles to those ones and so on. This is definitely possible but extremely time consuming, if you wanted to separate facts from non-facts for example.
		- a tree like system makes it very easy to realise what you don't know - you simply stumble upon it while moving through the interesting part of the tree

Having said that, the world definitely needs Wikipedia in exactly the shape and form that it is in today. To put it short:
- wikipedia is fantastic for quick <span style="color: #E8F;"><b>lookups</b></span> of anything
- tree-like system that is well made is great for <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>learning comprehensively and efficiently</b></span> about particular subjects

# Files and folders

Sometimes it could make sense to organise files and folders on a computer in a way that corresponds to the practical application statement in this note.

Generally if we organise files and folders so that each folder contains no more than 4 files and folders, the speed of finding what we are looking for will be the highest. However this comes at the expense of much more time being spent on organising those files and folders to fit this rule, and therefore it can easily be counter productive.

Let's consider the arguments for and against.

If it’s our personal computer, we might use certain folders daily, allowing us to rely on long-term memory to remember where things are. The main folder could contain, for example, 10 folders like "Documents," "Company Name 1," "Company Name 2," "Personal," "Books," "Cycling," "Fishing," etc. We remember this, so we don’t lose search speed. But if it’s a file system shared among multiple people, for instance, if ten people in a company work in a folder called "Administration," it could become justified to use a division of 4. Employees cannot rely as much on long-term memory in this case, and it will be much easier for a new employee to find their way around.

The important exceptions where organising by 4 is not giving any benefits are folders that are very clearly organised, such as a "Finance" folder containing subfolders like:
- 2022-01
- 2022-02
- 2022-03
- ...
- 2023-07
- 2023-08
In such a case, there could be even hundreds of these folders, but we can quickly find the month we’re looking for because we can skip over many folders at once while searching for the right one. In other words, this organisation system helps us avoid reading most folder names. Another example would be a "Customers" folder which contains customer folders sorted alphabetically.

Another consideration is how good the file search tool is. Typically on computers the search tools are relatively good and allow for quick finding of the correct file, even if it’s hidden in an obscure location, but:
- a very common IT problem is that the search tool just doesn’t find the file we’re looking for—we might have the correct folder open and see the file and its exact name, type it into the search bar, and it claims the file doesn’t exist
- we might not remember the exact name of the file
- we might not know if a file even exists, let's say a pdf scan of a contract that could have been signed 5 years ago, but it's not certain that it was

So if the search tool works fantastically well, there is less reason to think about implementing tree-like folder structure.

# The rules and regulations

Rules and regulations of a country:
- are a matter of extreme importance
- concern all citizens of that country
- constitute a large body of knowledge
- in principle should be created and modified after a very careful consideration and cooperation of multiple smart people
and as such the ease of exploration, as well as conciseness, should be the top priorities. This, in turn, means that rules and regulations should be structured like a tree with each branch splitting into no more than 4 branches.

Extras:
- rules and regulations should be difficult to create and easier to delete, if economic prosperity is to be taken seriously
	- it's much easier to create a successful company if it needs to follow 10 rules than if it needs to follow 1000 rules
- they should also have a version control implemented in a way that makes it extremely easy and free of charge for all citizens to check which lines of text were added, changed or removed from the given rule or regulation over time
