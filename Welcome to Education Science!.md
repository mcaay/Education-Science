As you might imagine <span style="color: #F84;"><b>there already is</b></span> a lot of research on education, teaching methods, learning principles and so on. Have you ever heard about it being applied somewhere in the classroom though?

Right. You most likely haven't.

That's pretty odd, isn't it? Wouldn't you agree that implementing scientifically proven methods in schools sounds like a rather good and basic idea?

The main problem is that it is <span style="color: #69F;"><b>not easy</b></span> for teachers to find relevant new findings in education. There is nobody that would just hand it to them on a silver platter. The aim of this website is to become that somebody.

> [!tip] Mission of EducationScience.org
> Collect important scientific findings related to education, present them in the most readable and concise way, and suggest practical, real-life applications based on those findings.

Let's get straight to it then!

The way this website is structured can be most easily illustrated by the tree-like diagram below.
