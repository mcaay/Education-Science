As you might imagine <span style="color: #F84;"><b>there already is</b></span> a lot of research on education, teaching methods, learning principles and so on. Have you ever heard about it being applied somewhere in the classroom though?

Right. You most likely haven't.

That's pretty odd, isn't it? Wouldn't you agree that implementing scientifically proven methods in schools sounds like a rather good and basic idea? Maybe even... like <span style="color: #F33;"><b>one of the most important things ever?</b></span>

Think about this - if we managed to accelerate student learning <span style="color: #E8F;"><b>twice</b></span>, they'd have their entire adult lives ahead of them to put that education to benefit their own lives and the lives of other people. And what if we could more than double it? What if our current education system is so ineffective that it is possible to achieve a <span style="color: #E8F;"><b>10-fold</b></span> improvement? Can you imagine what effect on the world would <span style="color: #E8F;"><b>that</b></span> have?

The main reason that science doesn't make its way to the classroom is that it is <span style="color: #69F;"><b>not easy</b></span> for teachers and policy-makers to find relevant new findings in education. There is nobody that would just hand it to them on a silver platter. The aim of this website is to become that somebody.

> [!tip] Mission of EducationScience.org
> Be a <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>fully free and collaborative</b></span> knowledge base that collects important scientific findings related to education and helps to bring them to the world in a way that maximizes simplicity and minimises the time and effort required to learn and implement those findings.

<span style="color: #9D5;"><b>Fully free</b></span> means:
- all website resources are <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>fully</b></span> accessible for free, forever and for everybody <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>in all its shapes and forms</b></span>
- <span style="color: #F33;"><b>no paid tiers of any kind</b></span>
- <span style="color: #F33;"><b>no ads</b></span>
- <span style="color: #F33;"><b>no selling of user data</b></span>
- website traffic can only ever be tracked 100% anonymously (so fully private browsing, no Google Analytics, no "accept tracking cookie banners")

We'll explain what the <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>collaborative</b></span> part means in a bit, as there are many aspects to it!

First let's briefly explain how the website works.

The knowledge base is structured in a way that can be most easily illustrated by the tree-like diagram below.
![[Pasted image 20240601155530.png]]

As it stands now, there are 4 main "branches" of the tree:
1. <span style="color: #F33;"><b>strong facts (strong scientific evidence)</b></span>
2. <span style="color: #F84;"><b>weak facts (weak scientific evidence)</b></span>
3. <span style="color: #CC2;"><b>guesses (no evidence except observation)</b></span>
4. BACKLOG (a place where unverified claims and unconnected practical applications can be added without creating chaos in the first three branches)

The outermost branches of the tree are <span style="color: #F33;"><b>facts</b></span> and <span style="color: #CC2;"><b>guesses</b></span> that usually come with at least one suggestion for their <span style="color: #69F;"><b>practical application</b></span>.

To navigate the tree, simply use the graph on the right side of this page, which shows the current page and the pages that are connected to it (branches). We could call those other pages <span style="color: #CC2;"><b>"child pages"</b></span> or <span style="color: #CC2;"><b>"children"</b></span> of the current page, and the current page could be called their <span style="color: #69F;"><b>"parent page"</b></span> or simply a <span style="color: #69F;"><b>"parent"</b></span>.

![[Pasted image 20240603204909.png|300]]

If you click one of the <span style="color: #CC2;"><b>child pages</b></span> you will go to that page and the graph on the right will update to show your current location on the tree.

Last small detail - the arrow direction might seem strange to you, as the <span style="color: #CC2;"><b>children</b></span> point to their <span style="color: #69F;"><b>parent</b></span>, and not the other way around. Trees grow up, not down, don't they?

There are a couple of reasons why knowledge trees should grow from the outermost branches to the trunk, but they are a bit too technical for a welcome page, so we'll cover them someplace else. For now simply remember that <span style="color: #CC2;"><b>child pages</b></span> point to <span style="color: #69F;"><b>parent pages</b></span>, so to get back to the trunk you can just follow the arrow direction.

Take a walk through the tree to test how it works and if anything seems particularly interesting to you, feel free to stop there to have a read :)
