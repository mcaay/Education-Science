# Tree structure

In the welcome page you have learned about the tree-like structure of this website and the basics of how to navigate it. It seems strange - why do it this way?

## Modularity

Imagine scenario A:
- you read a strong fact
- you read the science behind that fact
- you <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>agree</b></span> that it is indeed a strong fact
- you read the suggested practical application for this fact
- after consideration you <span style="color: #F33;"><b>disagree</b></span> that it is a good suggestion related to this fact
- <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>benefit:</b></span> you are free to discard this practical application as a bad one <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>without discarding anything else</b></span> - you can still think that other facts and other practical applications are very good

Likewise imagine scenario B:
- you read a strong fact
- you read the science behind that fact
- you <span style="color: #F33;"><b>disagree</b></span> that it is a strong fact
- <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>benefit:</b></span> you are free to discard this fact and related practical applications <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>without discarding anything else</b></span> - you can still think that other facts and other practical applications are very good

Tree-like structure makes it possible to achieve a high level of <span style="color: #E8F;"><b>modularity</b></span>.

When there is no modularity, that might mean the system is all tangled up, and if there is a mistake in one place, we probably have to also fix things in 10 other places which connected to the mistaken page in one way or another.

It might also mean that all the ideas and knowledge were bundled in one big package and if you don't agree with 2 things out of 10, you must reject the whole package. With modularity you can very easily disagree with some parts, while still benefitting fully from the other parts.
