# Tree structure

In the welcome page you have learned about the tree-like structure of this website and the basics of how to navigate it. As it definitely is quite unusual, let's talk about the most important points and reasons behind it.

## Modularity

Imagine scenario A:
- you read a strong fact
- you read the science behind that fact
- you <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>agree</b></span> that it is indeed a strong fact
- you read the suggested practical application for this fact
- after consideration you <span style="color: #F33;"><b>disagree</b></span> that it is a good suggestion
- <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>benefit:</b></span> you are free to discard this practical application as a bad one <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>without discarding the fact or anything else</b></span> - you can still think that other facts and other practical applications are very good

Likewise imagine scenario B:
- you read a strong fact
- you read the science behind that fact
- you <span style="color: #F33;"><b>disagree</b></span> that it is a strong fact
- <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>benefit:</b></span> you are free to discard this fact and related practical applications <span style="color: #9D5;"><b>without discarding anything else</b></span> - you can still think that other facts and other practical applications are very good

Tree-like structure makes it possible to achieve a high level of <span style="color: #E8F;"><b>modularity</b></span>. When there is a problem with some branch you can simply cut this branch off and the rest of the tree remains perfectly healthy.

<span style="color: #F33;"><b>When there is no modularity</b></span>, that might mean the system is all tangled up, and if there is a mistake in one place, we may also have to fix things in 10 other places. Imagine if there were several facts and their practical applications in one big article and one of them turned out to be incorrect. Chances are it wouldn't be sufficient to just delete a few paragraphs - you would have to edit also the parts in the introduction, in the summary and probably in other places that would be scattered all over the article.

So when there is no modularity the editor suffers. But the readers suffer too! Picture this - the reader gets a notification that the article was modified and wants to check what has changed. He has to read the entire article and figure out what is missing in order to know what turned out to be wrong. Alternatively the editor could have written a note that mentioned what was removed, so that would be another extra burden on the editor!

<span style="color: #F33;"><b>Another common problem</b></span> that comes from the lack of modularity is that often ideas and knowledge are bundled into a one big package. A well known example would be Montessori education. Imagine that you agree with 80% of ideas in Montessori education, but you just can't agree with the other 20%. What do you do then? Well, if the points on which you disagree are very important to you, you reject **the whole system**. It's <span style="color: #69F;"><b>not easy</b></span> to just split the system apart and choose what you like. With modularity you can very easily disagree with some parts, while still benefitting fully from the other parts.

## Ease of exploration

There are several commonly used knowledge management systems that are used by organisations (OKMS) and by individual people for personal knowledge keeping (PKMS). This can mean something as simple as using folders and files on your computer without any specific rules in mind or it can mean something indeed quite complicated.

One of the most common systems is called Zettelkasten, which you already know very well, because it is the system that Wikipedia uses. Its main characteristics are:
- there are no folders - all notes live in one big "folder"
- there is no tree-like structure nor any kind of other structure
- to find notes you nearly always use the search tool (or actually google it with the word "wikipedia" added)
- to explore the knowledge base you can jump from note to note by clicking the links in the articles that reference other articles
- to have all articles linking very eagerly to other articles is a key aspect of a Zettelkasten system

The main benefit of the Zettelkasten system for the knowledge bases like Wikipedia would be that it makes it very easy for the creators to create new articles, because they don't need to think <span style="color: #F84;"><b>where</b></span> to place the article - all articles go to the same big "folder".

The main drawback is that it is <span style="color: #F33;"><b>very hard to explore</b></span> the knowledge. Imagine spending a week reading Wikipedia articles about education systems. At the end of the week you have gone through 30 of them thoroughly. If you want to read about and evaluate all leading education systems, how many articles do you have left ahead of you? 20? 100? More? How do you know that you have read all of them?

<span style="color: #9D5;"><b>Exploring is precisely what we want to make easy</b></span> for the readers. And trees are very easy to explore. On the tree graph you see where the root is. You see where the outermost branches are. You can visually see more or less how many notes exist in the category that you are interested in. You can see that you have gone through 60% of notes in a given category. The notes are color coded, telling you what type of note it is. This is a strong fact, that is a weak fact and over there you have a practical application.

<span style="color: #F33;"><b>The downside</b></span> is that it is harder for creators to create new notes, because they have to very carefully think where it should be placed and sometimes it requires creating a new subcategory so that there are not too many branches growing out of one branch.

We think that accepting this downside is definitely the right choice for a project like this. Simply imagine that the creator spends 5x more effort on making the content simpler and more digestible than he could do otherwise. Let's also imagine that 1000 people read this content and because of the creator's extra effort, it takes them 30% less time to take away the key things from the content. The total balance of extra time expended vs. time saved would be extremely worth it.

As far as we know, the exact system that we are using here does not have a name yet. A huge mind map? Mind map kind of feels like something too small and it usually has just nodes without long content. If you have an idea for it, let us know :)

## 4 branches maximum

Between the main branches and the facts and guesses you will find some "category branches". What are those for? Well, if we just placed fifty strong facts in one huge branch that would not be too comfortable to explore.

In fact, we will use one rule that is perhaps a little unexpected:

> [!info] Rule
> One branch can have a maximum of 4 branches (unless it is one of the permitted special cases).

Why 4?

This is a <span style="color: #69F;"><b>practical application</b></span> of two <span style="color: #F33;"><b>strong scientific facts</b></span> related to education.

> [!tip] Fact 1
> Human working memory capacity is 4 Â± 1 elements or chunks.

> [!tip] Fact 2
> Grouping elements by 3 or 4 elements is optimal in terms of information finding speed.

Fact 1 means that if we group things by more than 4 elements per category, we are overwhelming the reader's brain with too much information presented at once.

Fact 2 means that if we want to respect the reader's time and make it as easy as possible for him to find whatever he is looking for, we should also group by no more than 4 elements.

First time hearing about those facts? You can jump to check the research behind them [here (fact 1)]() and [here (fact 2)]() if you'd like, but if you can, hold on just a minute longer.

## Why does the tree grow from the outside inwards?

## Permitted exceptions to the "maximum of 4 branches" rule
