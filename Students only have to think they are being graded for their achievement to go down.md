> Research has shown that [students only have to think they’re being graded](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/5JaJBLi5Ood1Uv?domain=psycnet.apa.org) for their achievement to go down. Math teachers who [replace grading with constructive written comments](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/g5g5B0fZd0ORF3?domain=psycnet.apa.org) increase student’s learning. I know the most freeing comment I give to my Stanford students is this: I am not going to give you a grade for this class. Do this for yourself, for your own learning.
