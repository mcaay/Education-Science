Batman... the Chris Nolan movie... the recent one and it's pretty freaking awesome... and you've got incredible special effects, great script, multiple takes, amazing actors and great sound and it's very engaging, but if you would instead say - okay, even if you have the same script (so at least it's the same script) and you said - okay, now instead of having movies, we're gonna have that script performed by the local town troupe... and so every small town in America, if movies didn't exist, they would have to then recreate the Dark Knight, you know... like home sewn costumes... and like... jumping across the stage... and not giving their lines quite right... and not really looking like the people in the movie... and no special effects... and I mean... that would SUCK! That would be terrible! That's education. :D"

Not only that though. The fact that it sucks is just one thing. The other is a huge waste of time of the teachers. Teachers have to prepare for the class. All this preparation time is done by thousands of teachers in parallel. If we had a cinema-like system, the teachers wouldn't have to prepare. They could just focus on helping students solve the practice questions during class.

I disliked physics until about the 3rd year of university. I didn't care about it. I always loved maths though, so it's not like I disliked all STEM subjects.

So what happened during the 3rd year of university?

I watched a youtube video of Richard Feynman explaining some concept in physics. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. I fell in love with physics immediately after this video.

He was boiling with enthusiasm so much that he pulled you in like a great book can.

Here is an [example video of Richard Feynman](https://youtu.be/ITpDrdtGAmo) where you can see this:
